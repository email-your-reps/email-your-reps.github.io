5. Edit index.html file to suit your needs. Change the mailto: address, the subject, the bcc recipients, and the message body to whatever you need them to be. (Tip: In the message body, if you need to add in a line break, use ```%0D%0A```) <br>

6. You should then be able to navigate to https://[your_github_username].github.io and it will produce the prewritten email. It may take a bit for the changes to load on the site.
