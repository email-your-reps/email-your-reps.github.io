1. Fork this GitHub repository
2. In the repository, go to Settings
3. Under the Repository Name section, edit your repo name to be [your_github_username].github.io
Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and make sure it says ```Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the master branch``` If it doesn't, then select "master branch" as the source.
4. Edit index.html file to suit your needs. Change the mailto: address, the subject, the bcc recipients, and the message body to whatever you need them to be. (Tip: In the message body, if you need to add in a line break, use %0D%0A)
